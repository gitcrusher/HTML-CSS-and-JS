    <h1>Aayush</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I would like to start my speech by a question “what if there is right environment given to faliures they could achive what toppers dream of”
        A warm welcome to <strong>everyone present here my dear ladies and gentlemen’s</strong>> let me took this opportunity to introduce me my name is Aayush Soni  and I am from MP Bhopal, so currently like you guys I am engraving my path as a software engineer from LPU, Now engineer how many of you are fascinated with this profession raise you hands,…, just like you guys when I talk or even think  about engineering it fascinates me and make me nostalgic  with its soldering fragrance and its  joyfulness and it takes me  back to our childhood to our homes, I think most of us played with remote cars  didn’t you ya, so for me specially wait ,wait,  wait a min I think we should go into a flashback now I want all of you  to think it’s a movie we are going  back into time with black and white screen  to our home to our childhood. As mischievous kid porbably 8 or 9 years old  who has been given remote control car as his birthday present and after 3 to 4 days it was used to get broken as out of curiosity to look into things I would use to take out motor circuits and play ….. wow ,just imagine those days how wonderful those days used to be , without any tension about one’s future ,hoof so yeah now I want all of you travel forward in some years and now in my journey when I decided to become like my idol when I saw the movie, but ,but,but before going to movie I want you all to sing a song from that movie with me and those who will not will be marked absent by mam (give me some sunshine give me some rain………. 2 lines) wow that’s awesome now can you guess which movie I was talking about and who could be my idol who was the inspiration behind that movie any  guesses , ya that’s right. Aamir Khan played a character named Phunsuk Wangdu who loved learning for the sake of learning and ended up starting a school in the hills where he taught children innovation and invention. But let me tell you this is no fiction. It’s the life and work of an out-of-the-box educator, Sonam Wangchuk.  sonam wanchuk sir born in 1966 the one of the most talented ,inovataive engineer  as well an excellent professor that a third world country has given to the world , could you have ever imagine a boy from ladhak where there were no schools , no transport facilities , no hospitals were there at that time  could stand up that high that you me and the world is proud of him, a small child who was discriminated on his primary education only because he was not knowing Kashmiri started up his primary education at 9 , facing poverty while doing his  masters degree but he still did it he made it from nit Srinagar mechanical engineer to a succesfull engineer , scientist ,innovator ,environmentalists as well as an education reformist ,to justify his  environmentalist personality  or  empathy as sir sonam wanchuk  lives surrounded by glaciers in the central Asian mountains, in a world that is melting in front of his eyes, given the effects of Global Warming due to which farmers of ladhak were struggling with water cricis for crop he made ICE STUPA for which he was honored with the prestigious and the highest awards in whole asia continent  (RAMON MAGSAYSAY AWARD) the Asian nobel prize  and became one of the 2 people to get such high level award,hi affection and  empathy towards students and for his people was so high that he opened SECMOL an education institute in leh Laddhak due to which where there were only 5 % of students used to pass 10th grade now its has became 75% and from this he received  international terra award and you know the fun fact that this whole campus doesn’t run on any fossil fuel lighting and heating they use solar and wind energy to run whole campus and could you guys recall what was the question I started with to that question this uy cam with this solution yes my friend there is only one eligibility criteria to enter that school that you must have failed in class 10th  yes that’s all . his empathy, perseverance and innovative personality  which we all will be needing as an engineer by  applying  the knowledge one must also have to find the problem which he will only be able to find by using empathy persuverence. His social service needs no introduction but for sake of our enhancement  he also built many projects which include (ice stupa the mini glacies whixh were made to help farmers, solar tents for Indian army fellows to stay warmer at high altitude do you know the difference in temperature in and outside the tent is -14 and 15 degrees celcuis respectively). He is having social awareness as his food for innovating mind which is also  a very important skill set to be learned by an engineer as him to fill the engineering gap in this third world country , this quality of him could be justifies by his protests and by one of his campaign where he took ice bar from northpole and gave it to da lai lama in order to  break stereotypes to learn all these skill set I will be pushing my self more in the competitive environment through which I can develop problem solving and good discission making skills and as their soul is empathy I would also be mastering that . for innovation I will be reading refreshers and the magzzines and after learning these skill I would mold me into an engineer who could serve the humanity by understanding their problem and by solving it,We live in a world where technology might be available in plenty, but the intelligence, creativity, and empathy IS required to make these skills work for human betterment seems to be in short supply. Visionaries like Wangchuk SIR provide a guiding light to developing the 21st-century skills and habits of problem-solving, community leadership and agile thinking with their revolutionary educational methods. by FOLLOWING HIS PATHWAY bi want to become robotics engineer I want to shift the title the “hub of robotics” from Japan and Germany to India I want to create that awareness and boom in robotics like it has in computers science  cause the future is of robots as It would help melting the difference between peoples and to ease the life’s by increasing  the standard of living ,The medical condition and the factory works which include the risk of the live will be neglected , I would also love to work with isro on many robotic project and will make india to fly with eagles by using robots for that  too  in constant manner. Sonam Wangchuk sir is a true Harappa Habit Hero. He not only understands the importance of Harappa Habits like Think, Solve, and Lead, but also helps ensure people learn them when they are young.  Guys you know what  His struggle his this situation reminds me golden words by senior Bachchan sir “agar apni marzi ka ho to achcha aur agar nahi ho to to bohot achcha ” and it also reminds me a little but a motivating story where he said these golden words to Amitabh Bachchan when he was in his early age in drama school and fallen ill due to which he wasn’t able to participate in that drama we was so sad demotivated then his father said those golden word which amitab ji also says was the key to his success the quote actually states that every one has their destiny no one can take that from you when you are sad about anything leave it to godly powers and focus on the present, by this quote I live my life  whenever my in life things goes worst after a lot of trying I leave it god and focus on present oppurtunity and magic happens sfter some time problem get resolved automatically , I think that when sir sonam wanchuk  was struggling he might also said the same and as a result now you could see that those difficulty and that quote has made him to reach the 7th  cloud of success , in the end with a positive thought I would like to repeat the very famous lines from 3 ideots movie “don’t follow the success follow the excellence and success will chase you”
